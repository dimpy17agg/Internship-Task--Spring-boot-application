#Excel Sheet is generated using Apache POI.


#APACHE POI
It’s the framework from the Apache Software Foundation which helps you to create Microsoft formats like Word, PowerPoint, and - among others - Excel. Personally speaking, I believe Excel is the most important product Microsoft ever made. You may ask what about Google Sheets or Apples Numbers. But when it comes to enterprises, almost everybody uses Excel.

#Creating Excel Sheets 
Dealing with Excel in Java is very simple, thanks to Apache POI. However, Apache POI is not an official library from Microsoft. In fact, it’s almost reengineering the Microsoft Excel format, at least the old binary formats. The new formats are XML based and do not need such reengineering.
Of course, with the flexibility now offered for XML and other open formats, creating Excel files has become a lot easier.
